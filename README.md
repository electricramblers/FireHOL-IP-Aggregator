# Aggregator of FireHOL IP lists
–êpplication for keeping feeds from <a href="https://github.com/firehol/blocklist-ipsets" target="_blank">blocklist-ipsets</a> (only *.netset and *.ipset files are aggregated) in PostgreSQL with including historical changes. For requests developed HTTP-based API service. 

Some features of keeping and processing data:
* New data is written to existing data with `last_added` field update.
* Data deleted from reputation feed is not deleted from the application database. For such data, `last_removed` field is updated.
* Field `timeline` is based on events of adding and removing item from reputation list.

### Start application

To start the collection module and the HTTP-based API service, just type:
```
sudo docker-compose up -d
```
The collection module will start automatically.

By default, the HTTP-based API service is available by port 8000.

### API

There are several API-functions for obtaining various information about feeds:

* POST `/search` - retrieve all information about requested IP or CIDR format objects
* GET `/feeds` - retrieve all information about feeds
* GET `/feeds/categories` - retrieve all feed categories
* GET `/feeds/maintainers` - retrieve all feed maintainers
* GET `/feed/info` - retrieve all available information about the feed by its name
* GET `/maintainer/info` - retrieve all available information about the maintainer by its name
* GET `/maintainers/by_category` - retrieve all maintainers by category
* GET `/ip/bulk/by_category` - retrieve all IP addresses that are in feeds filtered by feed category

The API documentation is accessed by requesting any undefined URL.

### Example usage

Application is able to get search requests in IP or CIDR format, also in mixed list of both data types (provided by `/search` function). To search, run the command:
```
python client.py -s 149.255.60.136
```

Here is an example of the result of the request IP `149.255.60.136` using the client:
```
{
    "blacklisted_count": 1,
    "currently_blacklisted_count": 0,
    "feeds_available": 188,

            "hits": [
                {
                    "category": "reputation",
                    "current_status": "absent",
                    "entries": "37968 unique IPs",

                    "maintainer": "hpHosts",

                    "source_file_date": "Wed Jan 31 16:18:34 UTC 2018",
                    "timeline": [
                        {
                            "added": "2017-11-08T12:00:38.932354",
                            "removed": "2017-11-19T07:09:04.321675"
                        },
                        {
                            "added": "2018-01-12T11:35:49.283765",
                            "removed": ""
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ],
            "hits_count": 1,
            "ip": "149.255.60.136",
            "last_added": "2018-01-12T11:35:49.283765+00:00"
        }
    ]
}

```
If the observable is not found in the application database, the response will look like this:
```
{
    "blacklisted_count": 0,
    "currently_blacklisted_count": 0,
    "feeds_available": 188,
    "request_time": "2018-02-02T14:31:17.291948+03:00",
    "requested_count": 1,
    "results": []
}
```

To get more information about the client usage, type:
```
python client.py -h
```

Also you can generate search requests using cURL:
```
curl -X POST --data '8.8.8.8,1.1.1.1' -H 'Content-Type: text/html' localhost:8000/search
```

### Important files

* `client.py` - simple python script for convenient interaction with FireHOL-IP-Aggregator API.
* `conf/app.conf` - the main configuration file with several parameters.
* `conf/postgresql.conf` - the main Postgres configuration file (generated with http://pgtune.leopard.in.ua/).
* `app/entrypoint.sh` - the entry point for the application container.
* `docker-persistence/app-data/log/run.log` - the main log file.

### Application configuration

The most important configuration parameters from `conf/app.conf` are listed in the table below.

| Parameter | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| `"unique_ips_limit"` | Defines the limit of the number of unique IP addresses in FireHOL feeds that will be aggregated (the goal is to filter out huge feeds) |
| `"sync_period_h"` | Defines time period for syncing with FireHOL IP list repository |
| `"firehol_ipsets_git"` | Defines FireHOL IP lists repository url |

Also it's possible to change count of workers that process queries to API in `app/entrypoint.sh` by changing `--workers` argument value.
```
gunicorn --bind=0.0.0.0:8000 --workers=4 --timeout 3600 api:__hug_wsgi__
```
It's recommended to use 2 workers per 1 core (do not forget to change `max_connections` parameter in `conf/postgresql.conf`).

To apply configuration changes you should rebuild containers:
```
sudo docker-compose down
sudo docker-compose up --build
```
